## Document 3: Service Proposal Template (Customize for Each Client)

### What It Is
A professional proposal template with three service packages and pricing.

### When to Use It
- After completing a website audit
- When a client asks for a quote
- When following up with leads
- For formal business proposals

### How to Customize It

**Step 1: Replace Placeholders**

Find and replace these throughout the document:
- `[CLIENT_NAME]` → Actual client name
- `[CLIENT_WEBSITE]` → Their website URL
- `[DATE]` → Today's date
- `[NUMBER]` → Actual numbers from audit
- `[XX]` → Actual percentages/scores
- `[AMOUNT]` → Your pricing
- `[YOUR_PHONE]` → Your phone number
- `[BOOKING_LINK]` → Your calendar link

**Step 2: Fill in Audit Results**

Replace the "Overall Score" section with real data:
```markdown
### Overall Score: 62/100

| Category | Current Score | Industry Average | Potential Score |
|----------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| SEO | 55/100 | 75/100 | 85/100 |
| Performance | 48/100 | 70/100 | 90/100 |
| Mobile | 72/100 | 80/100 | 95/100 |
```

**Step 3: List Specific Issues**

Replace the generic issue sections with actual problems you found:
```markdown
### 1. Slow Page Load Time (4.8 seconds)

**Impact:** 🔴 Critical
**Current State:** Your homepage takes 4.8 seconds to load. Google 
recommends under 2.5 seconds.
**Business Impact:** You're losing approximately 40% of visitors who 
abandon before the page loads. This could be costing you £2,000-3,000 
per month in lost sales.
**Solution:** Optimize images (reduce from 3.2MB to 400KB), enable 
browser caching, implement CDN.
**Timeline:** 1 week
**Investment:** £800
```

**Step 4: Adjust Pricing**

Use the internal pricing guidelines at the bottom of the template:
- Small business (1-10 pages): £1,200-1,800 (Essential)
- Medium business (11-30 pages): £3,500-5,000 (Growth)
- Large business (31+ pages): £8,000-12,000 (Complete)

**Step 5: Remove Internal Notes**

Delete the entire "Internal Notes" section at the bottom before sending!

**Step 6: Add Case Studies (Optional)**

If you have relevant case studies, add them to Appendix B. If not, remove that section.

## Pricing Strategy

### How to Price Your Services

**Method 1: Time-Based Pricing**
1. Estimate hours required for each fix
2. Multiply by your hourly rate (£50-100/hour)
3. Add 20-30% buffer for unexpected issues
4. Package it up

**Example:**
- Title tags (2 hours × £75) = £150
- Image optimization (3 hours × £75) = £225
- Performance fixes (6 hours × £75) = £450
- **Total:** £825 → **Package Price:** £1,000

**Method 2: Value-Based Pricing**
1. Calculate the value to the client
2. Price based on ROI, not hours

**Example:**
- Client makes £10,000/month revenue
- 20% increase = £2,000/month extra = £24,000/year
- Your fee: £3,000 (12.5% of annual value)
- Client gets £24,000 value for £3,000 investment = 8x ROI

**Method 3: Competitor-Based Pricing**
- Research what other agencies charge
- Position yourself slightly below (you're new) or at market rate

**UK Market Rates (2026):**
- Basic SEO fixes: £1,000-2,000
- Comprehensive optimization: £3,000-6,000
- Full website rebuild: £5,000-15,000
- Monthly SEO management: £500-2,000/month

### Package Pricing Tips

**Essential Fixes:** Price for quick wins and cash flow
- Low barrier to entry
- Gets clients in the door
- Upsell to bigger packages later

**Growth Accelerator:** Your main offering
- Best value perception
- Highest profit margin
- Most clients choose this

**Complete Transformation:** For serious clients
- Premium pricing
- Includes ongoing work
- Builds long-term relationships

## Common Objections & Responses

### "That's too expensive"

**Response:**
"I understand budget is important. Let me break down what you're getting:

[List specific deliverables and value]

This investment could generate [£X] in additional revenue per month. 
That means you'll break even in [X] months, and everything after that 
is pure profit.

If budget is tight right now, we can start with the Essential Fixes 
package at [£X] and upgrade later."

### "I'll do it myself"

**Response:**
"That's great! I've included the Action Blueprint which shows you 
exactly how to do it.

Most business owners find they don't have the time or technical 
knowledge to implement everything. If you get stuck or want to hand 
it off, I'm here to help.

I also offer a 'done-with-you' option where I guide you through the 
process at £75/hour. That way you learn and save money."

### "I need to think about it"

**Response:**
"Absolutely, this is an important decision. What specific concerns 
do you have that I can address?

[Listen and address concerns]

This proposal is valid for 30 days. After that, I may need to 
re-audit your site as things change quickly online.

Can we schedule a follow-up call for [DATE] to discuss any questions?"

### "Can you guarantee results?"

**Response:**
"I can guarantee that we'll implement all the technical fixes and 
best practices. What I can't control is Google's algorithm or your 
competitors' actions.

That said, I'm so confident in our process that I offer a 30-Day 
Results Guarantee: If you don't see measurable improvement in your 
website's performance within 30 days, I'll work for free until you do.

I can also show you case studies of similar businesses we've helped."
